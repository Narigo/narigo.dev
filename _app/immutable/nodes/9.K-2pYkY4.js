		back, once blue-white is positioned correctly. Then do orange-white with the same approach and

		possibly facing in the wrong directions.`,F,f,pt="Top color in the bottom row, facing to the side",G,_,ft=`The best direction to have is the top color being placed in the bottom row corners and facing to
		the side. If that's the case, move it to the same spot as the corner where it needs to be
		placed. Then, rotate the bottom row left, if it was facing to the left or right, if it was
		facing to the right. Rotate the side of the cube that will not rotate the corner you looked at

		of the sides so that the unsolved top corner will go to the place where the corner is that we
		want to make face sideways. Move the corner away from the side after the rotation. Rotate the
		side back up.

To get the
		second row, look at the pieces that need to go to the sides. If the upper face was white, there
		need to be red-blue, blue-orange, orange-green and green-red pieces somewhere on the cube. If
		they happen to be in the bottom row: Perfect! Let's say red-blue is there with red facing to the
		side and blue to the bottom. Move it below red first, so it looks like having a red "T" on the
		side that needs red. The algorithm to solve this is: Move it away from the blue side, rotate the
		blue side anti-clockwise, so the white side shows on the red side. Now move the red-blue piece
		from before back to red. Rotate the blue side clockwise again, making the corner, that needs to
		go into the upper row again, line up with the red-blue piece from the beginning. Now move it in
		the direction of blue, rotate the red side clockwise, the bottom piece back and the red side
		anti-clockwise again. The red-blue piece should now sit in the correct spot. This has to be done
		with all the sides. If one of the sides sits at the correct position but it facing in the wrong
		direction, move it out by putting something from the bottom row in (one of the yellow ones).
		This way, you can restart the algorithm of this step after moving the piece into the place where
		it should be started from: lining up with a center piece.`,X,H,xt="Rubiks 4x4",Y,P,Ct=`I like the genericness of the 4x4 cube as you can play it like a 3x3 and a 2x2, depending on how
