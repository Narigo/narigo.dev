	<h2>Training</h2>
	<p>
		At some point, my dentist sent me a link to a workout that strengthens your back. I've been
		doing these workouts myself but at some point, it didn't really work well with the iPad anymore
		(screen turns off and sound doesn't play). So I'm trying to recreate this, to make it work on
		all of my devices.
	</p>
	<p>
		The page started with some settings, to customize the workout for yourself. When you press
		start, it gives you a few seconds to see an image of someone doing the exercise and text
		explaining what to do. After that, you should do the exercise for some seconds before it jumps
		to the next one.
