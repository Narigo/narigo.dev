<ArticleLayout title="JavaScript CraftCamp 2024 - #JSCC24" lastUpdateOn="2024-06-24">
	<p>
		It's done! The JavaScript CraftCamp 2024 is over! Due to a lot of other commitments before the
		event, it has been really exhausting for me this time.
	</p>
	<p>
		But before jumping into anything here: Thanks a ton for all the participants of this year's
		JSCC! I have never seen such a great spirit towards learning and crafting elsewhere. So glad
		this is working out.
	</p>
	<p>
		There wasn't really much negative feeback this time and most of the people I asked could only
		share good memories. We definitely have a few things we can improve next time (especially a
		longer wrap-up), but overall, I'd say the JSCraftCamp has been a huge success.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is always some trouble before the event to get everything done on schedule. I think we're
		always underestimating the time it takes for t-shirts: Find a sponsor, find a company to handle
		printing, check in with the sponsor, whether the price is still okay after getting offers for
		printing and after getting the sponsors approval: Find another company quickly because the
		printing company found out that they don't have the bandwidth to print it on time anymore.
	</p>
	<p>
		Really, we all have to thank Sina for handling the t-shirt situation perfectly and getting not
		only the shirts but a lot more logistics organized prior to the event, despite any issues
		popping up! Also, she stayed around quite a while and came in early just that the participants
		could stay as long as possible. And she has over an hour to commute...!
	</p>
	<p>
		Another big thanks to the Maiborn-Wolff team who helped us a lot during the event itself. It was
		extremely helpful to have a couple of people around who could help with the building, giving
		directions and jumping in with cables and other things when needed.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the event itself, I'm trying my best to be a participant myself and hope not to have to
		organize too much on the fly. It's great to have people on the orga team like Bernd who can
		easily switch from participant to (hardcore) orga mode: He got people to go out with him to buy
		ice cream for everybody on both days, be around when food or drinks get delivered, making
		everybody aware of the situations and even getting us to find a just-in-time sponsor! Really
		glad to have him!
	</p>
	<h2>Improvements</h2>
	<p>
		We had a bit of a mix-up regarding the rooms and I feel bad about it since some sponsors were a
		little bit less exposed due to the naming of the rooms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another thing we did was reserving sponsors up to 5 seats. We didn't communicate well enough to
		have them reserve the seats through pull requests as well. In the end, it all went okay, but it
		was definitely something that could have caused bigger issues.
	</p>
	<p>
		While I love having lots of sponsors and I'm happy for every company that sponsors any amount of
		money, I feel that sponsors who invest more money should have at least some incentive to do
		more. This could be more seats, more exposure (room names come to mind) or other things. We
		don't want to have one big sponsor ruling over everything though. It should still be a lot more
		community members than seats from sponsors.
	</p>
	<p>
		There was some feedback from the location that something wasn't done correctly with the
		beverages. We should improve our checklist for the end of the event to make everybody happy
		after the event is over. Basically, the cleanup could have been done better.
	</p>
	<h2>Personal Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		For me, organizing the JSCraftCamp feels like a great way to give back to the community that
		helped me out so much already. I have found friends and business partners through these meetups
		that started this and it feels great when people say thanks for helping them.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's good to hear from participants that they really like this event and they want to have this
		more often. It seems to be inspiring and motivating for a lot of people here and I would
		definitely like to see more events like this. Maybe having this in a smaller scale throughout
		the year would be cool.
	</p>
	<p>
		Still, organizing an event like the JSCC, getting the community involved, finding sponsors and
		keeping all of them hyped sometimes felt like a second job to me. As my time constraints are
		much more limited than they have been before becoming a parent, I'm unsure whether I can
		continue delivering a good job on the orga front. I'd love to see more people stepping up and
		trying to help us organize the whole thing. I can't even tell yet whether I have enough time
		next year.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's see whether I can at least do some online work for the community...! I'll start with some
		CSSBattle sessions and maybe someone will resurrect the Crafters vs Codewars at some point...?
