		It's done! The JavaScript CraftCamp 2023 is over. I'm happy I got the chance to help organizing
		the event.
	</p>
	<p>First of all, thanks to all the participants, making this event so great!</p>
	<p>
		We had some struggles to organize everything and there is always a time where you think "this is
		not going to work", especially when little sponsors are showing up in the beginning. A couple of
		things were organized "on the fly", like having enough BBQ grills. And some stuff just worked
		out by chance shortly before the event - like having Friday's breakfast sponsored.
