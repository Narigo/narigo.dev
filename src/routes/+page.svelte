		<h2>Welcome to JÃ¶rns page! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
		<Narigo>
			<p>
				It's another stab at building a homepage for myself. I don't want to spend much time
				maintaining a page. But I need a place where I can put up slides. And maybe some other
				content that I want to share for an extended period of time.

				This time, it's built with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" rel="external">SvelteKit</a>.

		<h2>FAQ ðŸ™‹</h2>
		<h3>Who are you? ðŸ¤”</h3>
		<Narigo>
			<p>I'm JÃ¶rn. A software engineer focused on building applications for the web.</p>
		</Narigo>
		<h3>What do you do? ðŸ¤”</h3>
		<Narigo>
			<p>
				I work at <a href="https://compose.us/" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
					>compose.us</a
				> and our team builds digital services. That means we're building internal and external tools
				to make our customer's offerings more efficient and user friendly.
			</p>
		</Narigo>
		<Narigo>
			<p>
				In my spare time, I'm helping to organize the <a
					href="https://jscraftcamp.org/"
					rel="external noopener noreferrer"
					target="_blank">JSCraftCamp</a
				>, which is a two-day Barcamp / Open Space in Munich. You can attend it for free thanks to
				lots of sponsors. Every time I attend this event, I leave with new friends, professional
				contacts and much more knowledge than before.
			</p>
			<p>
				For <a href="https://virtualcoffee.io" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
					>VirtualCoffee.io</a
				>, I organize the "Frontend Friday Folks battling
				<a href="https://cssbattle.dev" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
					>CSSBattle.dev</a
				>", which is a place where people with all kind of levels in CSS proficiency learn something
				from each other.
			</p>
		</Narigo>
		<Narigo side="right">
			<p>
				...and since the Frontend Friday Folks is a really nice format, I'm trying something similar
				with JavaScript katas now. You can join through <a
					href="https://www.meetup.com/js-craftcamp/events/291808574/"
					rel="external">the JSCraftCamp meetup group</a
				>, which will guide you to the JSCraftCamp Discord community where we'll host it.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're doing it weekly now: Every Thursday at 19:00 CEST, at least until the JSCraftCamp
				starts.
			</p>

		<h3>Are you available for hire? ðŸ¤”</h3>
		<Narigo>
			<p>
				Usually, I work with my own team and we're building web applications. If you need assistance
				from senior developers to help you deliver high quality software while leveling up your own
				team, shoot me a message!
			</p>
		</Narigo>
		<h3>Why is this here again? ðŸ¤”</h3>
		<Narigo>
			<p>I needed a space where I can put slides for talks online.</p>
			<p>But I somehow started building a "real" web page...</p>
			<p>
				I even started <a href="{base}/articles/pocuter-one"
					>a longer article about using and programming a Pocuter</a
				>.
