			<p>
				It's another stab at building a homepage for myself. I don't want to spend much time
				maintaining a page. But I need a place where I can put up slides. And maybe some other
				content that I want to share for an extended period of time.

				I work at <a href="https://compose.us/" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
					>compose.us</a

				internal and external tools to make their offerings more efficient and user friendly.
