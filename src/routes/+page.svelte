		<h2>Welcome to JÃ¶rns page! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
		<p>
			It's another stab at building a homepage for myself. I don't have a blog, I don't want to
			spend much time on this page. But I need a place where I can put up slides. And maybe some
			other content that I want to share for an extended period of time without having to trust
			third parties.

		<p>This time, it's built with SvelteKit.</p>

		<h3>Why is this here again? ðŸ¤”</h3>
		<p>I needed a space where I can put slides for talks online.</p>
