		<h2>Welcome to JÃ¶rns page! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
		<Narigo>
			<p>
				It's another stab at building a homepage for myself. I don't want to spend much time
				maintaining a page. But I need a place where I can put up slides. And maybe some other
				content that I want to share for an extended period of time.

				I work at <a href="https://compose.us/" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
					>compose.us</a
				> and our team builds digital services for public administrations. That means we're building
				internal and external tools to make their offerings more efficient and user friendly.

				In my spare time, I'm helping to organize the <a
					href="https://jscraftcamp.org/"
					rel="external noopener noreferrer"
					target="_blank">JSCraftCamp</a
				>, which is a two-day Barcamp / Open Space in Munich. You can attend it for free thanks to
				lots of sponsors. Every time I attend this event, I leave with new friends, professional
				contacts and much more knowledge than before.
			</p>
			<p>
				For VirtualCoffee.io, I organize the "Frontend Friday Folks battling <a
					href="https://cssbattle.dev"
					rel="external noopener noreferrer"
					target="_blank">CSSBattle.dev</a
				>", which is a place where people with all kind of levels in CSS proficiency learn something
				from each other.

		<h3>Why is this here again? ðŸ¤”</h3>
		<Narigo>
			<p>I needed a space where I can put slides for talks online.</p>
