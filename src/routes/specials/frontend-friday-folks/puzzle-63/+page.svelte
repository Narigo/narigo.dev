		<p>
			This time it was Satoshi and me, but I had a little blocker on my arm, so I had to solve it a
			day later on my own. I like <code>-webkit-box-reflect</code>, but I'm always a bit surprised
			how it works - especially when using absolute or fixed positioning and pseudo-elements. I
			think, I need to look into this more!
		</p>
		<p>
			I wanted to try solving it using the Unicode character "âŒ˜" as the CSSBattle discussions
			sometimes say that people are using UTF-8 characters to solve puzzles. I can't make it over
			92.1% with this char, so I'm unsure how that works for others.
