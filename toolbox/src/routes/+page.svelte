<h1>Toolbox</h1>
<p>
	I use a lot of online tools myself and thanks to ads and cookie banners, the experience is not
	really that great. So I thought I'm going to build a couple of tools myself whenever I have time
	and see what I can do. Maybe even have some webassembly tools like image converter or similar
	things. Tools that could be used offline as well. Let's see where this goes.
</p>
<p>For now, I want to build:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Base64 encoder / decoder</li>
	<li>URL encoder / decoder</li>
	<li>JWT extractor</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Oh, and I'm going to try out this localisation that was added by <code>sv create</code>:
	ParaglideJS.
