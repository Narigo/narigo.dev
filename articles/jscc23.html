The JavaScript CraftCamp 2023 is over. I&#39;m happy I got the chance to help organizing
		the event.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-u5xjkh">First of all, thanks to all the participants, making this event so great!</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1my76tq">We had some struggles to organize everything and there is always a time where you think &quot;this is
		not going to work&quot;, especially when little sponsors are showing up in the beginning. A couple of
		things were organized &quot;on the fly&quot;, like having enough BBQ grills. And some stuff just worked
		out by chance shortly before the event - like having Friday&#39;s breakfast sponsored.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-rapos2">What went well</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-odnzq2">When organizing such an event, I&#39;m focused more on the things that did not work out so well.
		It&#39;s great that we received a lot of positive feedback from the participants. People mentioned
		they&#39;ll join again next time and the community discord was very active and attracted quite a few
		new members - even after the event!</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-10ippmp">Things we can improve</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-13vjfz1">We have written down a couple of <a href="https://github.com/jscraftcamp/website/issues/1723" rel="external">improvement opportunities in the JSCraftCamp repository</a>. If you have comments or feedback, I&#39;d be happy to read them in the comments of the linked
		issue!</p> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1r1zatt"><li>PR is a hurdle, takes time and is &quot;difficult&quot;</li> <li>explain/show pacman rule to make groups of people open</li> <li>split session presentation and room finding, to speed it up</li> <li>propose people to have others present their session, if wanted</li> <li>prepare a location-orga-cheatsheet, when does what happen and who takes care, prepared upfront</li> <li>in multiple sessions: 2 or 3 people spoke ~80% of time without looking if others wanted to
			talk. making it hard to include those people ‚Üí some people talk louder (mention this issue at
			the start of the day) and maybe session hosts can moderate if necessary</li></ul> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-fv7ueg">Registration process</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1j2w04c">The general feedback for the PR was usually that it&#39;s too time consuming and difficult. I have
		helped everyone who wanted to register and I even went into video chats with people to do it
		with them. There were probably others who didn&#39;t take the time or had the motivation to register
		due to this fact. Another problem with this registration is the openness of it. Some people just
		don&#39;t want to tell everybody what events they attend and we should make sure they can feel
		welcome as well.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1buotcv">I have to admit that I kind of like the PR approach as it weeds out people who are not willing
		to invest time into this event. We have a very low no-show rate at the event and I believe this
		is due to the fact that people had to commit something to be able to attend (pun only slightly
		intended). I&#39;m okay with trying out a different registration process next time though: Helping
		people to register and unregister was quite a big time investment for myself.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-10c4meg">I&#39;d be happy to hear ideas from the community about this!</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-x78gf7">Community building</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-13ykt2m">For myself, I think being more engaged in the Discord and organize remote events after the event
		itself would be nice. I imagine some of the new Discord members can feel lost, since there were
		weren&#39;t a lot of community events since the JSCraftCamp. We collected some ideas but we did not
		have someone to execute them. In the coming months, I hope I can invest more time into this.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1vbhtrg">What&#39;s next?</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-180qzwi">It&#39;s 2024 now, we recently started conducting our weekly orga calls again. Let&#39;s find a
		location, sponsors and meet in June / July again!</p></div></article></div></main> <footer class="px-4 py-8" data-svelte-h="svelte-1cf50in"><div class="flex flex-row flex-wrap gap-8 justify-between mx-auto max-w-[--max-page-width] p-4"><div><a class="no-underline" href="../imprint">‚ÑπÔ∏è Imprint</a></div> <div>¬© J√∂rn Bernhardt</div> <div>Statically hosted on GitHub Pages.</div> <div><a class="no-underline" href="https://github.com/Narigo/narigo.dev" rel="external">Source</a></div></div></footer> </div>
